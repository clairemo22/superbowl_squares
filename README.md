# superbowl_squares

In the past I've been at super bowl parties where there has been an abundance of controversy over squares. 

Why do people think you can choose your own square, with the numbers already set out (especially if there is no randomized selection order)?

The year the patriots won 13-3 I think one person took home the pot after almost every quarter (he was a football guy and selected 0-3, 3-0 etc). 

Anway, this year, I randomized the drawing and selection of numbers to ensure no collusion. Super easy script but posting it here anyway.
